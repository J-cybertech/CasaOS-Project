# CasaOS-Project

  Project Description
        Creating a HyperVm that's running Debian 12 no GUI, hosting CasaOS to manage several other projects. Used HyperVm for the purpose of learning another virtual host other then VirtualBox. With HyperVm I learned the difference between the three virtual switches: External, Internal, Private. CasaOS is a open-source community project that allows you to build a personal cloud system in a docker ecosystem; which is super user-friendly. Once installed you can browse "apps" that are included in the "App store". You are able to add more packages from the [Casa github repo](https://awesome.casaos.io/content/3rd-party-app-stores/list.html#_2-casaos-appstore-play).

 I mainly wanted an aternative way to remote into my computer from a different network thats more secure then just leaving my network open. I've done ---- (add another project here, how to enable RDP and have it open to the internet)

Rustdesk and Twingate was my first runner up. Twingate is a zero trust network access, offering an alternative to traditional VPNs. Rustdesk is an open-source remote desktop with self-hosted server, encrypting any connections.
